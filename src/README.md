# HexaWget 🚀🌐

Hello there, Internet adventurers! Welcome to the world of **HexaWget**, where downloading files is not just fast, it's Hexa-fast! 🏎💨 Imagine a world where your downloads happen in the blink of an eye, where waiting is a thing of the past. That's HexaWget for you - the superhero of download managers! 🦸

## Idea Behind HexaWget 🤔💡

Ever felt like regular downloads are just... slow? 🐢 Like watching paint dry? That's where HexaWget swoops in! We decided to break the norm, ditch the single-threaded snooze fest, and introduce a world where downloading is split into six supercharged parts, all working in parallel! It's like having six mini downloaders doing your bidding at the same time. Efficiency at its finest! 🌟

## Features of HexaWget 🌈🔥

- **Split Personality**: Divides your download into six parts, because why download with one when you can download with six? More is merrier! 🥳
- **Lightning Fast**: It's like strapping a rocket to your download. Zoom through the Internet and grab what you need, fast! 🚀
- **Super Simple**: No need to be a tech wizard to use HexaWget. It's as easy as pie, and who doesn't like pie? 🍰

## How It Works 🛠👀

HexaWget takes your file, splits it into six even parts, and then sends out its six little minions (threads) to fetch them. Each minion works independently, braving the wilds of the internet to bring back their part of the treasure. Once they all return, HexaWget stitches these parts together to give you your complete file. It's like a jigsaw puzzle, but more fun! 🧩

## Installation 📦✨

Before you can unleash the power of HexaWget, you need to set it up. Don't worry; it's as easy as stealing candy from a baby (not that we endorse that sort of thing 😉).

1. Make sure you have `gcc` and `make` installed. They're our trusty tools.
2. Run the following command to install the necessary libraries:

   ```sh
   sudo apt install libcurl4-gnutls-dev build-essential -y
   ```

## Usage 🖥🚀

Ready to turbocharge your downloads? Follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/awesome-you/hexawget.git`
2. Navigate to the HexaWget directory: `cd hexawget`
3. Run:

   ```sh
   sudo make build
   ```

   This will compile everything and create the `hexa` executable.
4. To download a file, simply run:

   ```sh
   ./hexa <URL>
   ```

   Replace `<URL>` with the link to the file you want to download.

## Cleaning Up 🧹🗑

After you're done, if you want to clean up (though why would you ever want to stop using HexaWget?), just run:

```sh
make clean
```

## Disclaimer ⚠️👀

While HexaWget is super awesome, remember it's mostly for fun and educational purposes. It's not as secure as your regular browsers or download managers. So, use it wisely and don't go downloading anything shady! 🕵️‍♂️
